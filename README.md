## Why our application will give accurate results?

![](public/better-model.png)

- Our model utilizes PyTesseract to find the words such as amount/total/grand total/cash usually found on Kenyan bills/reciept and creating a bounding box around these using openCV
- Since there was low training data available on Kenyan bills coupled with time constraints, we had to rely on third party nanonets API for backup
- We are cross-examining both results and finding the better of the two

## Tech-stack

- React and it's related packages
- Django rest framework
- PyTessearct, OpenCV, RegEx

## Motivation?

- To build something that is relevant to current needs
    - [80% Kenyans Say Covid-19 A Wakeup Call To Fix Their Financial Health]

-  To build our first PWA
